# Sandbox Internet Browsing

As per CSE Top 10 - Isolate Web-facing applications, Organizations should use virtualization to create an environment where Web-facing applications can run in isolation.

Security exploits specific to such applications can be confined to this sandbox. Any malware that infects the virtualized environment cannot get out of the sandbox; therefore, the malware cannot infect the host or enterprise.
